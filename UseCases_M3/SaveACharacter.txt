Title: Save a character

Primary Actor: Player

Stakeholders: Only the player has an interest in this use case.

Precondition: The player must be logged into a character.

Postcondition: A new save file is created or another is overwritten with the current state of the character allowing it to be loaded in the future.

Main Success Scenario: The player selects the save option then the system saves the current state of the game.

Extensions/Alternative Flows: 
-- If there's already a save file associated with the character, a dialog will appear confirming if the player wants to overwrite the old saved state.
-- An error occurs disallowing the player to save and nothing is done.
